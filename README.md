## Probabilistic Graphical Model Implementation

This repository also includes an implementation of the classic **Student Network** from Daphne Koller's textbook using the [thrml](https://github.com/extropic-ai/thrml) library.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the PGM example
python3 student_network_pgm.py
```

See [PGM_README.md](PGM_README.md) for detailed documentation about the probabilistic graphical model implementation.
